
Based on Version: 1.6.6.0 (Build 1500) 2011/02/21
English Format Sakura by Lucien Murray-Pitts


The is the English translation of Sakura Editor.  Some of the menus are a little cramped as often the Japanese for the button or label is shorter than the English, although its fairly usable we will be working to rectify the dialog sizes for English versions.

If you run this on a Windows system that doesnt have Extended Text support then you will end up seeing "mojibake" rather than the Japanese text you are expecting to see.  You will need to install Japanese character support, then set the "Language for non-unicode program" options to enable this as your alternative langauge for non-unicode programs (which Sakura 1.6.6.0 is).

You can read more about this setting in the links below;

If you are only editing English documents then you dont need to add these extra language packs.

Cheers,
